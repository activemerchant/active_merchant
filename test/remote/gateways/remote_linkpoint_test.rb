#
# In order for this test to pass, a valid store number and PEM file
# are required. Unfortunately, with LinkPoint YOU CAN'T JUST USE ANY
# OLD STORE NUMBER. Also, you can't just generate your own PEM file.
# You'll need to use a special PEM file provided by LinkPoint.
#
# Go to http://www.linkpoint.com/support/sup_teststore.asp to set up
# a test account.  Once you receive your test account you can get your
# pem file by clicking the Support link on the navigation menu and then
# clicking the Download Center link.
#
# You will also want to change your test account's fraud settings
# while running these tests.  Click the admin link at the top of
# LinkPoint Central.  Then click "set lockout times" under Fraud Settings
# You will want to set Duplicate lockout time to 0 so that you can run
# the tests more than once without triggering this fraud detection.
#
# The LinkPoint staging server will also return different responses based
# on the cent amount of the purhcase. Complete details can be found at
require 'test_helper'
