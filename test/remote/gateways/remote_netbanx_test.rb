  #   # You tried a credit transaction for a settlement that has not been batched,
  #   # so there is no balance available to be credited. A settlement is typically
  #   # in a pending state until midnight of the day that it is requested, at
  #   # which point it is batched. You cannot credit that settlement until it has
  #   # been batched. Verify the credit card for which you are attempting the
