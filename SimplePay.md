# Simple Pay Gateway

## Usage:

The gateway provides **two different methods** for bank transactions. One when the response contains a redirect URL, where the users can fulfill the transaction by providing their card data.

### Initialize the gateway:

* *:redirectURL* - The url, where the users will be redirected after the transactions
* *:timeout* - Time interval (in minutes) till the transaction can be completed.
* *:currency* - Transactions currency. Avaiable choices ['HUF', 'EUR', 'USD'].

```ruby
require 'active_merchant'

#Enable testing mode. ( SANDBOX )
ActiveMerchant::Billing::Base.mode = :test 

gateway = ActiveMerchant::Billing::SimplePayGateway.new(
    :merchantID  => 'PUBLICTESTHUF',
    :merchantKEY => 'FxDa5w314kLlNseq2sKuVwaqZshZT5d6',
    :redirectURL => 'https://www.myawesomewebsite.com/redirect-back',
    :timeout     => 30,
    :currency    => 'HUF'
)

# OR you can provide multiple urls, depending on the transaction status

gateway = ActiveMerchant::Billing::SimplePayGateway.new(
    :merchantID  => 'PUBLICTESTHUF',
    :merchantKEY => 'FxDa5w314kLlNseq2sKuVwaqZshZT5d6',
    :urls => {
        :success => 'https://www.myawesomewebsite.com/success',
        :fail    => 'https://www.myawesomewebsite.com/fail',
        :cancel  => 'https://www.myawesomewebsite.com/cancel',
        :timeout => 'https://www.myawesomewebsite.com/timeout'
    },
    :timeout     => 30
)
```

### Responses

The response contains all the information about the transaction, in the reponses message. The responses are JSON strings wilth all the information about the transaction.
```ruby
res.message
```

On error the response message will contain the error message.

## Methods

### **purchase()**

After sucessfull call, the response message will contain a *:redirectURL*, where the customer should be redirected, to finish the transaction.

In case if collecting the card data, transaction is possible without redirection.
[See auto method](#auto)

**This is the least amount of information you will need to start a transaction.**
**Later on they will be refered as # MANDATORY FIELDS...**

```ruby
res = gateway.purchase({
    :amount => 2000,
    :email => 'customer@email.hu',
    :address => {
        :name =>  'Customer Name',
        :country => 'HU',
        :state => 'Budapest',
        :city => 'Budapest',
        :zip => '1111',
        :address1 => 'Address u.1',
    }
})
```

#### Optional fields:

##### *:orderRef:*

Note: the gateway automaticly generates these numbers, but to ensure they are unique you should privide your own.

```ruby
res = gateway.purchase({
    # MANDATORY FIELDS ...
    :orderRef => 's0m30rd3r3fg3n3r4t3d'
})
```

##### *:invoice*

* company
* address2
* phone

##### *:items*

If both :amount, and :items are present, :amount will be ignored. 

```ruby
res = gateway.purchase({
    # MANDATORY FIELDS ...
    :items => [
        {
        :ref => "Product ID 2",
        :title => "Product name 2",
        :description => "Product description 2",
        :amount => "2",
        :price => "5",
        :tax => "0",
        :shippingCost => '1',
        :discount => '3',
        :customer => 'IfDifferentThen [:address][:name]'
        }
    ]
})
```

##### *:delivery*

```ruby
res = gateway.purchase({
    # MANDATORY FIELDS ...
    :delivery => [
        {
        :name => "SimplePay V2 Tester",
        :company => "Company name",
        :country => "hu",
        :state => "Budapest",
        :city => "Budapest",
        :zip => "1111",
        :address => "Delivery address",
        :address2 => "",
        :phone => "06203164978"
        }
    ]
})
```

##### *:methods*

If the payment method is not *CARD* you can set it in the options.

```ruby
res = gateway.purchase({
    # MANDATORY FIELDS ...
    :methods => ['WIRE']
})
```

**3DS Requirements**

* customerEmail
* invoice
* name
* country
* state
* city
* zip
* address

If they are not known, you can use *:maySelectEmail* or *:maySelectInvoice* options.

```ruby
res = gateway.purchase({
    # MANDATORY FIELDS ...
    :maySelectEmail => true,
    :maySelectInvoice => true
})
```

Also you could ask for delivery informations. You will need to specify the countires where delivery is possible.

```ruby
res = gateway.purchase({
    # MANDATORY FIELDS ...
    :maySelectDelivery => ["HU","AT","DE"]
})
```

If you would like to start a recurring transaction these options must be present.

* *:times* - How many tokens to generate?
* *:until* - Expiary date of the token.
* *:maxAmount* - Max amount to charge with the token.

Tokens will be created and avaiable in the respond's message.

To start a recurring transaction behind the scenes (with a token) [See dorecurring()](#dorecurring)

```ruby
res = gateway.purchase({
    # MANDATORY FIELDS ...
    :recurring => {
        :times => 1,
        :until => "2022-12-01T18:00:00+02:00",
        :maxAmount => 2000
    }
})
```

This will charge the customer. If you would like to only register the card, add *:onlyCardReg* field to the options:

```ruby
res = gateway.purchase({
    # MANDATORY FIELDS ...
    :onlyCardReg => true
})

```
