# Simple Pay Gateway

## Usecases:

The gateway provides **two different methods** for bank transactions. One when the response contains a redirect URL, where the users can fulfill tthe transaction by providing their card data.

### Initialize the gateway:

```ruby
require 'active_merchant'

#Enable testing mode.
ActiveMerchant::Billing::Base.mode = :test 

#redirectURL: is the url, where the users will be redirected after the transactions
#timeout: Time interval (in minutes) till the transaction can be completed.
gateway = ActiveMerchant::Billing::SimplePayGateway.new(
    :merchantID  => 'PUBLICTESTHUF',
    :merchantKEY => 'FxDa5w314kLlNseq2sKuVwaqZshZT5d6',
    :redirectURL => 'https://www.myawesomewebsite.com/redirect-back',
    :timeout     => 30
)

# OR you can provide multiple urls, depending on the transaction status

gateway = ActiveMerchant::Billing::SimplePayGateway.new(
    :merchantID  => 'PUBLICTESTHUF',
    :merchantKEY => 'FxDa5w314kLlNseq2sKuVwaqZshZT5d6',
    :urls => {
        :success => 'https://www.myawesomewebsite.com/success',
        :fail    => 'https://www.myawesomewebsite.com/fail',
        :cancel  => 'https://www.myawesomewebsite.com/cancel',
        :timeout => 'https://www.myawesomewebsite.com/timeout'
    },
    :timeout     => 30
)
```

The gateways provides these methods for making transactions
    
* [purchase()](#purchase)
* [authorize()](#authorize)
* [capture()](#capture)
* [refund()](#refund)
* [query()](#query)
* [auto()](#auto)

## Responses

The response contains all the information about the transaction, in the reponses message.
```ruby
res.message
```

### **purchase()**

After sucessfull call, the response message will contain a *:redirectURL*, where the customer should be redirected, to finish the transaction.

In case if collecting the card data, transaction is possible without redirection.
[See auto method](#auto)

```ruby
res = gateway.purchase({
    :ammount => 2000,
    :email => 'customer@email.hu',
    :threeDSReqAuthMethod => '01', #???
    :address => {
        :name =>  'myname',
        :company => 'company',
        :country => 'HU',
        :state => 'Budapest',
        :city => 'Budapest',
        :zip => '1111',
        :address1 => 'Address u.1',
        :address2 => 'Address u.2',
        :phone => '06301111111'
    },
    # Optionally you can define items for the transaction.
    # If both :ammount, and :items are present, :ammount will be ignored.
    :items => [
        {
        :ref => "Product ID 2",
        :title => "Product name 2",
        :description => "Product description 2",
        :amount => "2",
        :price => "5",
        :tax => "0"
        }
    ]
