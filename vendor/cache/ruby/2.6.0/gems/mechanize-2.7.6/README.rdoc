This library comes with a shameless plug for employing me
(Aaron[http://tenderlovemaking.com/]) programming Ruby, my favorite language!

== Acknowledgments

This library was heavily influenced by its namesake in the Perl world.  A big
thanks goes to {Andy Lester}[http://petdance.com],
the author of the original Perl module WWW::Mechanize which is available
here[http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize/].  Ruby Mechanize would not be around without you!

Thank you to Michael Neumann for starting the Ruby version.  Thanks to everyone
who's helped out in various ways.  Finally, thank you to the people using this
library!
