  * Fixed redirection counting in following meta refresh. #240

=== 2.5.1

=== 2.5

* Minor enhancements

  * Worked around ruby 1.8 run with -Ku and ISO-8859-1 encoded characters in
    URIs.  Issue #228 by Stanislav O.Pogrebnyak

=== 2.4

* Security fix:

  Mechanize#auth and Mechanize#basic_auth allowed disclosure of passwords to
  malicious servers and have been deprecated.

  In prior versions of mechanize only one set of HTTP authentication
  credentials were allowed for all connections.  If a mechanize instance
  connected to more than one server then a malicious server detecting
  mechanize could ask for HTTP Basic authentication.  This would expose the
  username and password intended only for one server.

  Mechanize#auth and Mechanize#basic_auth now warn when used.

  To fix the warning switch to Mechanize#add_auth which requires the URI
  the credentials are intended for, the username and the password.
  Optionally an HTTP authentication realm or NTLM domain may be provided.

* Minor enhancement
  * Improved exception messages for 401 Unauthorized responses.  Mechanize now
    tells you if you were missing credentials, had an incorrect password, etc.

=== 2.3 / 2012-02-20

* Minor enhancements
  * Add support for the Max-Age attribute in the Set-Cookie header.
  * Added Mechanize::Download#body for compatibility with Mechanize::File when
    using Mechanize#get_file with Mechanize::Image or other Download-based
    pluggable parser.  Issue #202 by angas
  * Mechanize#max_file_buffer may be set to nil to disable creation of
    Tempfiles.

* Bug fixes
  * Applied Mechanize#max_file_buffer to the Content-Encoding handlers as well
    to prevent extra Tempfiles for small gzip or deflate response
  * Increased the default Mechanize#max_file_buffer to 100,000 bytes.  This
    gives ~5MB of response bodies in memory with the default history setting
    of 50 pages (depending on GC behavior).
  * Ignore empty path/domain attributes.
  * Cookies with an empty Expires attribute value were stored as session
    cookies but cookies without the Expires attribute were not.  Issue #78

=== 2.2.1 / 2012-02-13

* Bug fixes
  * Add missing file to the gem, ensure that missing files won't cause
    failures again.  Issue #201 by Alex
  * Fix minor grammar issue in README.  Issue #200 by Shane Becker.

=== 2.2 / 2012-02-12

* API changes
  * MetaRefresh#href is not normalized to an absolute URL, but set to the
    original value and resolved later.  It is even set to nil when the
    Refresh URL is unspecified or empty.

* Minor enhancements
  * Expose ssl_version from net-http-persistent.  Patch by astera.
  * SSL parameters and proxy may now be set at any time.  Issue #194 by
    dsisnero.
  * Improved Mechanize::Page with #image_with and #images_with and
    Mechanize::Page::Image various img element attribute accessors, #caption,
    #extname, #mime_type and #fetch.  Pull request #173 by kitamomonga
  * Added MIME type parsing for content-types in Mechanize::PluggableParser
    for fine-grained parser choices.  Parsers will be chosen based on exact
    match, simplified type or media type in that order.  See
    Mechanize::PluggableParser#[]=.
  * Added Mechanize#download which downloads a response body to an IO-like or
    filename.
  * Added Mechanize::DirectorySaver which saves responses in a single
    directory.  Issue #187 by yoshie902a.
  * Added Mechanize::Page::Link#noreferrer?
  * The documentation for Mechanize::Page#search and #at now show that both
    XPath and CSS expressions are allowed.  Issue #199 by Shane Becker.

* Bug fixes
  * Fixed handling of a HEAD request with Accept-Encoding: gzip.  Issue #198
    by Oleg Dashevskii
  * Use #resolve for resolving a Location header value.  fixes #197
  * A Refresh value can have whitespaces around the semicolon and equal sign.
  * MetaRefresh#click no longer sends out Referer.
  * A link with an empty href is now resolved correctly where previously the
    query part was dropped.

=== 2.1.1 / 2012-02-03

* Bug fixes
  * Set missing idle_timeout default.  Issue #196
  * Meta refresh URIs are now escaped (excluding %).  Issue #177
  * Fix charset name extraction.  Issue #180
  * A Referer URI sent on request no longer includes user information
    or fragment part.
  * Tempfiles for storing response bodies are unlinked upon creation to avoid
    possible lack of finalization.  Issue #183
  * The default maximum history size is now 50 pages to avoid filling up a
    disk with tempfiles accidentally.  Related to Issue #183
  * Errors in bodies with deflate and gzip responses now result in a
    Mechanize::Error instead of silently being ignored and causing future
    errors.  Issue #185
  * Mechanize now raises an UnauthorizedError instead of crashing when a 403
    response does not contain a www-authenticate header.  Issue #181
  * Mechanize gives a useful exception when attempting to click buttons across
    pages.  Issue #186
  * Added note to Mechanize#cert_store describing how to add certificates in
    case your system does not come with a default set.  Issue #179
  * Invalid content-disposition headers are now ignored.  Issue #191
  * Fix NTLM by recognizing the "Negotiation" challenge instead of endlessly
    looping.  Issue #192
  * Allow specification of the NTLM domain through Mechanize#auth.  Issue #193
  * Documented how to convert a Mechanize::ResponseReadError into a File or
    Page, along with a new method #force_parse.  Issue #176

=== 2.1 / 2011-12-20

* Deprecations
  * Mechanize#get no longer accepts an options hash.
  * Mechanize::Util::to_native_charset has been removed.

* Minor enhancements
  * Mechanize now depends on net-http-persistent 2.3+.  This new version
    brings idle timeouts to help with the dreaded "too many connection resets"
    issue when POSTing to a closed connection.  Issue #123
  * SSL connections will be verified against the system certificate store by
    default.
  * Added Mechanize#retry_change_requests to allow mechanize to retry POST and
    other non-idempotent requests when you know it is safe to do so.  Issue
    #123
  * Mechanize can now stream files directly to disk without loading them into
    memory first through Mechanize::Download, a pluggable parser for
    downloading files.

    All responses larger than Mechanize#max_file_buffer are downloaded to a
    Tempfile.  For backwards compatibility Mechanize::File subclasses still
    load the response body into memory.

    To force all unknown content types to download to disk instead of memory
    set:

      agent.pluggable_parser.default = Mechanize::Download
  * Added Mechanize#content_encoding_hooks which allow handling of
    non-standard content encodings like "agzip".  Patch #125 by kitamomonga
  * Added dom_class to elements and the element matcher like dom_id.  Patch
    #156 by Dan Hansen.
  * Added support for the HTML5 keygen form element.  See
    http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-keygen-element  Patch #157
    by Victor Costan.
  * Mechanize no longer follows meta refreshes that have no "url=" in the
    content attribute to avoid infinite loops.  To follow a meta refresh to
    the same page set Mechanize#follow_meta_refresh_self to true.  Issue #134
    by Jo Hund.
  * Updated 'Mac Safari' User-Agent alias to Safari 5.1.1.  'Mac Safari 4' can
    be used for the old 'Mac Safari' alias.
  * When given multiple HTTP authentication options mechanize now picks the
    strongest method.
  * Improvements to HTTP authorization:
    * mechanize raises Mechanize::UnathorizedError for 401 responses which is
      a sublcass of Mechanize::ResponseCodeError.
    * Added support for NTLM authentication, but this has not been tested.
  * Mechanize::Cookie.new accepts attributes in a hash.
  * Mechanize::CookieJar#<<(cookie) (alias: add!) is added.  Issue #139
  * Different mechanize instances may now have different loggers.  Issue #122
  * Mechanize now accepts a proxy port as a service name or number string.
    Issue #167

* Bug fixes
  * Mechanize now handles cookies just as most modern browsers do,
    roughly based on RFC 6265.
    * domain=.example.com (which is invalid) is considered identical to
      domain=example.com.
    * A cookie with domain=example.com is sent to host.sub.example.com
      as well as host.example.com and example.com.
    * A cookie with domain=TLD (no dots) is accepted and sent if the
      host name is TLD, and rejected otherwise.  To retain compatibility
      and convention, host/domain names starting with "local" are exempt
      from this rule.
    * A cookie with no domain attribute is only sent to the original
      host.
    * A cookie with an Effective TLD is rejected based on the public
      suffix list. (cf. http://publicsuffix.org/)
    * "Secure" cookies are not sent via non-https connection.
    * Subdomain match is not performed against an IP address.
    * It is recommended that you clear out existing cookie jars for
      regeneration because previously saved cookies may not have been
      parsed correctly.
  * Mechanize takes more care to avoid saving files with certain unsafe names.
    You should still take care not to use mechanize to save files directly
    into your home directory ($HOME).  Issue #163.
  * Mechanize#cookie_jar= works again.  Issue #126
  * The original Referer value persists on redirection.  Issue #150
  * Do not send a referer on a Refresh header based redirection.
  * Fixed encoding error in tests when LANG=C.  Patch #142 by jinschoi.
  * The order of items in a form submission now match the DOM order.  Patch
    #129 by kitamomonga
  * Fixed proxy example in EXAMPLE.  Issue #146 by NielsKSchjoedt

=== 2.0.1 / 2011-06-28

Mechanize now uses minitest to avoid 1.9 vs 1.8 assertion availability in
test/unit

* Bug Fixes
  * Restored Mechanize#set_proxy.  Issue #117, #118, #119
  * Mechanize::CookieJar#load now lazy-loads YAML.  Issue #118
  * Mechanize#keep_alive_time no longer crashes but does nothing as
    net-http-persistent does not support HTTP/1.0 keep-alive extensions.
