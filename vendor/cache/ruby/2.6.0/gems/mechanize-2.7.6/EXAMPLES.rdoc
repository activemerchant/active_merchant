= Mechanize examples

Note: Several examples show methods chained to the end of do/end blocks.
<code>do...end</code> is the same as curly braces (<code>{...}</code>).  For
example, <code>do ... end.submit</code> is the same as <code>{ ...
}.submit</code>.

== Google

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'

  a = Mechanize.new { |agent|
    agent.user_agent_alias = 'Mac Safari'
  }

  a.get('http://google.com/') do |page|
    search_result = page.form_with(:id => 'gbqf') do |search|
      search.q = 'Hello world'
    end.submit

    search_result.links.each do |link|
      puts link.text
    end
  end

== Rubyforge

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'

  a = Mechanize.new
  a.get('http://rubyforge.org/') do |page|
    # Click the login link
    login_page = a.click(page.link_with(:text => /Log In/))

    # Submit the login form
    my_page = login_page.form_with(:action => '/account/login.php') do |f|
      f.form_loginname  = ARGV[0]
      f.form_pw         = ARGV[1]
    end.click_button

    my_page.links.each do |link|
      text = link.text.strip
      next unless text.length > 0
      puts text
    end
  end

== File Upload

Upload a file to flickr.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'

  abort "#{$0} login passwd filename" if (ARGV.size != 3)

  a = Mechanize.new { |agent|
    # Flickr refreshes after login
    agent.follow_meta_refresh = true
  }

  a.get('http://flickr.com/') do |home_page|
    signin_page = a.click(home_page.link_with(:text => /Sign In/))

    my_page = signin_page.form_with(:name => 'login_form') do |form|
      form.login  = ARGV[0]
      form.passwd = ARGV[1]
    end.submit

    # Click the upload link
    upload_page = a.click(my_page.link_with(:text => /Upload/))

    # We want the basic upload page.
    upload_page = a.click(upload_page.link_with(:text => /basic Uploader/))

    # Upload the file
    upload_page.form_with(:method => 'POST') do |upload_form|
      upload_form.file_uploads.first.file_name = ARGV[2]
    end.submit
  end

== Pluggable Parsers

Let's say you want HTML pages to automatically be parsed with Rubyful Soup.
This example shows you how:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'
  require 'rubyful_soup'

  class SoupParser < Mechanize::Page
    attr_reader :soup
    def initialize(uri = nil, response = nil, body = nil, code = nil)
      @soup = BeautifulSoup.new(body)
      super(uri, response, body, code)
    end
  end

  agent = Mechanize.new
  agent.pluggable_parser.html = SoupParser

Now all HTML pages will be parsed with the SoupParser class, and automatically
give you access to a method called 'soup' where you can get access to the
Beautiful Soup for that page.

== Using a proxy

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'

  agent = Mechanize.new
  agent.set_proxy 'localhost', 8000
  page = agent.get(ARGV[0])
  puts page.body

== The transact method

Mechanize#transact runs the given block and then resets the page history. I.e.
after the block has been executed, you're back at the original page; no need
to count how many times to call the back method at the end of a loop (while
accounting for possible exceptions).

This example also demonstrates subclassing Mechanize.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'

  class TestMech < Mechanize
    def process
      get 'http://rubyforge.org/'
      search_form = page.forms.first
      search_form.words = 'WWW'
      submit search_form

      page.links_with(:href => %r{/projects/} ).each do |link|
        next if link.href =~ %r{/projects/support/}

        puts 'Loading %-30s %s' % [link.href, link.text]
        begin
          transact do
            click link
            # Do stuff, maybe click more links.
          end
          # Now we're back at the original page.

        rescue => e
          $stderr.puts "#{e.class}: #{e.message}"
        end
      end
    end
  end

  TestMech.new.process

== Client Certificate Authentication (Mutual Auth)

In most cases a client certificate is created as an additional layer of
security for certain websites.  The specific case that this was initially
tested on was for automating the download of archived images from a banks
(Wachovia) lockbox system.  Once the certificate is installed into your
browser you will have to export it and split the certificate and private key
into separate files.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'

  # create Mechanize instance
  agent = Mechanize.new

  # set the path of the certificate file
  agent.cert = 'example.cer'

  # set the path of the private key file
  agent.key = 'example.key'

  # get the login form & fill it out with the username/password
  login_form = agent.get("http://example.com/login_page").form('Login')
  login_form.Userid = 'TestUser'
  login_form.Password = 'TestPassword'

  # submit login form
  agent.submit(login_form, login_form.buttons.first)

Exported files are usually in .p12 format (IE 7 & Firefox 2.0) which stands
for PKCS #12.  You can convert them from p12 to pem format by using the
following commands:

  openssl pkcs12 -in input_file.p12 -clcerts -out example.key -nocerts -nodes
  openssl pkcs12 -in input_file.p12 -clcerts -out example.cer -nokeys
