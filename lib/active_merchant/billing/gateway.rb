    # 
    # == Description
    # The Gateway class is the base class for all ActiveMerchant gateway implementations. 
    # 
    # The standard list of gateway functions that most concrete gateway subclasses implement is:
    # 
    # * <tt>purchase(money, creditcard, options = {})</tt>
    # * <tt>authorize(money, creditcard, options = {})</tt>
    # * <tt>capture(money, authorization, options = {})</tt>
    # * <tt>void(identification, options = {})</tt>
    # * <tt>credit(money, identification, options = {})</tt>
    #
    # Some gateways include features for recurring billing
    #
    # * <tt>recurring(money, creditcard, options = {})</tt>
    #
    # Some gateways also support features for storing credit cards:
    #
    # * <tt>store(creditcard, options = {})</tt>
    # * <tt>unstore(identification, options = {})</tt>
    # 
    # === Gateway Options
    # The options hash consists of the following options:
    #
    # * <tt>:order_id</tt> - The order number
    # * <tt>:ip</tt> - The IP address of the customer making the purchase
    # * <tt>:customer</tt> - The name, customer number, or other information that identifies the customer
    # * <tt>:invoice</tt> - The invoice number
    # * <tt>:merchant</tt> - The name or description of the merchant offering the product
    # * <tt>:description</tt> - A description of the transaction
    # * <tt>:email</tt> - The email address of the customer
    # * <tt>:currency</tt> - The currency of the transaction.  Only important when you are using a currency that is not the default with a gateway that supports multiple currencies.
    # * <tt>:billing_address</tt> - A hash containing the billing address of the customer.
    # * <tt>:shipping_address</tt> - A hash containing the shipping address of the customer.
    # 
    # The <tt>:billing_address</tt>, and <tt>:shipping_address</tt> hashes can have the following keys:
    # 
    # * <tt>:name</tt> - The full name of the customer.
    # * <tt>:company</tt> - The company name of the customer.
    # * <tt>:address1</tt> - The primary street address of the customer.
    # * <tt>:address2</tt> - Additional line of address information.
    # * <tt>:city</tt> - The city of the customer.
    # * <tt>:state</tt> - The state of the customer.  The 2 digit code for US and Canadian addresses. The full name of the state or province for foreign addresses.
    # * <tt>:country</tt> - The [ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code](http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/english_country_names_and_code_elements.htm) for the customer.
    # * <tt>:zip</tt> - The zip or postal code of the customer.
    # * <tt>:phone</tt> - The phone number of the customer.
