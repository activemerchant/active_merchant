    # Gateway for netregistry.com.au.
    #
    # Note that NetRegistry itself uses gateway service providers.  At the
    # time of this writing, there are at least two (Quest and Ingenico).
    # This module has only been tested with Quest.
    #
    # Also note that NetRegistry does not offer a test mode, nor does it
    # have support for the authorize/capture/void functionality by default
    # (you may arrange for this as described in "Programming for
    # NetRegistry's E-commerce Gateway." [http://rubyurl.com/hNG]), and no
    # #void functionality is documented.  As a result, the #authorize and
    # #capture have not yet been tested through a live gateway, and #void
    # will raise an error.
    #
    # If you have this functionality enabled, please consider contributing
    # to ActiveMerchant by writing tests/code for these methods, and
    # submitting a patch.
    #
    # In addition to the standard ActiveMerchant functionality, the
    # response will contain a 'receipt' parameter
    # (response.params['receipt']) if a receipt was issued by the gateway.
