  module Billing #:nodoc:
    # TO USE:
    # First, make sure you have everything setup correctly and all of your dependencies in place with:
    #
    #   require 'rubygems'
    #   require 'active_merchant'
    #
    # ActiveMerchant expects amounts to be Integer values in cents
    #
    #   tendollar = 1000
    #
    # Next, create a credit card object using a TC approved test card.
    #
    #   creditcard = ActiveMerchant::Billing::CreditCard.new(
    #	    :number => '4111111111111111',
    #	    :month => 8,
    #	    :year => 2006,
    #	    :first_name => 'Longbob',
    #     :last_name => 'Longsen'
    #   )
    #
    # To finish setting up, create the active_merchant object you will be using, with the TrustCommerce gateway. If you have a
    # functional TrustCommerce account, replace login and password with your account info. Otherwise the defaults will work for
    # testing.
    #
    #   gateway = ActiveMerchant::Billing::Base.gateway(:trust_commerce).new(:login => "TestMerchant", :password => "password")
    #
    # Now we are ready to process our transaction
    #
    #   response = gateway.purchase(tendollar, creditcard)
    #
    # Sending a transaction to TrustCommerce with active_merchant returns a Response object, which consistently allows you to:
    #
    # 1) Check whether the transaction was successful
    #
    #   response.success?
    #
    # 2) Retrieve any message returned by TrustCommerce, either a "transaction was successful" note or an explanation of why the
    # transaction was rejected.
    #
    #   response.message
    #
    # 3) Retrieve and store the unique transaction ID returned by Trust Commerece, for use in referencing the transaction in the future.
    #
    #   response.params["transid"]
    #
    # For higher performance and failover with the TrustCommerceGateway you can install the TCLink library from http://www.trustcommerce.com/tclink.html.
    # Follow the instructions available there to get it working on your system. ActiveMerchant will automatically use tclink if available.
    #
    # The TCLink library has the following added benefits:
    #  * Good transaction times. Transaction duration under 1.2 seconds are common.
    #  * Fail-over to geographically distributed servers for extreme reliability
    #
    # Once it is installed, you should be able to make sure
    # that it is visible to your ruby install by opening irb and typing "require 'tclink'", which should return "true".
    #
    # This should be enough to get you started with Trust Commerce and active_merchant. For further information, review the methods
    # below and the rest of active_merchant's documentation, as well as Trust Commerce's user and developer documentation.
