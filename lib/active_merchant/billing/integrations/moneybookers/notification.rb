We strongly recommend that you do NOT process the order/transaction in your system upon receipt of a pending status from Moneybookers.
          # ‘-1’ Cancelled – Pending transactions can either be cancelled manually by the sender in their online account history or they will auto-cancel after 14 days if still pending.

          # ‘-3’ Chargeback – This status could be received only if your account is configured to receive chargebacks. If this is the case, whenever a chargeback is received by Moneybookers, a -3 status will be posted on the status_url for the reversed transaction.
